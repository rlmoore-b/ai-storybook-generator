DEPRECATED: Original CLI Version

This file contains the original command-line interface implementation of the 
story generator. It has been superseded by the Flask web application (app.py).

This file is kept for the assignment requirement comment.

Before submitting the assignment, describe here in a few sentences what you would have built next if you spent 2 more hours on this project:

If I had two more hours, I would build a "Story Series" feature that would utilize vector embeddings to 
maintain characters and settings across stories. This would work by storing the previous stories in a vector database 
and using a RAG to get relevant context during generation. Finally, I would add authentication with google
or Apple giving persistance to the user's stories and allowing them to track their reading progress.
